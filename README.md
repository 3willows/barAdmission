Note to self:

- Add testing framework
- Use a transpiler (of sorts) e.g. [Lightning CSS](https://lightningcss.dev/transpilation.html) to convert flex and grid into older CSS, so that the case title styling works on the Word version too.
- Plan how to expand this to cover the Quick Affirmation functionalities via draw.io or Figma.
