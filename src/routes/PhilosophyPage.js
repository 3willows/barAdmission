              This is part of an ongoing project to provide basic, boilerplate,
              information about Hong Kong litigation to anyone interested.

              In an ideal world, everyone should have an intuitive understanding
              of the litigation process. Everyone should be able to put
              themselves in the shoes of the Judge, and have a feel for the kind
              of job she needs to do.

              This will help everyone appreciate the value added by lawyers,
              and inform discussions about the place of law in a civilised
              society.
